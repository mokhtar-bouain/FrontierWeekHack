# Build and Scale AI Agents with Microsoft Foundry
## The Level 3: Architect learning path 
 
Welcome to the hands-on lab experience where ideas turn into real, enterprise-ready solutions. This is the most advanced of the three agent-building learning paths. Where the Explorer path builds your first no-code agent and the Maker path automates work with low-code tools, this path is for developers, engineers, and architects who want complete control over models, orchestration, and operations.

In this lab, you’ll build, monitor, evaluate, and orchestrate AI agents using the Microsoft Foundry SDK. You’ll follow a guided, scenario-based experience designed to help you move from concept to a working, enterprise-ready multi-agent system.
 
By the end, you won’t just understand how agents work — you’ll have built one you can trace, evaluate, and deploy.

All challenge instructions are also available at [microsoft.github.io/FrontierWeekHack](https://microsoft.github.io/FrontierWeekHack/).

## What You'll Learn

This lab walks you through the full lifecycle of building production-ready AI agents with [Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/):

- **Agent design** — Create purpose-built agents with system prompts, tools, and domain-specific data
- **Observability** — Instrument agents with OpenTelemetry-based GenAI tracing via Application Insights
- **Quality evaluation** — Run LLM-as-judge evaluations to systematically measure agent output quality
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — Wire agents into automated workflows using the Python SDK and the Foundry portal

This is a **code-first hackathon** — you'll write and run Python throughout. However, several challenges also have you interact with the **Microsoft Foundry portal** to deploy models, explore traces, review evaluations, and build workflows visually. Expect to move between your IDE and the portal regularly.


## Choose Your Scenario

All paths teach the same Foundry concepts — pick the one that resonates with you the most:

| Scenario | Description | Start Here |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| 🏭 **Factory** | Detect machine anomalies and diagnose faults at TireForge Industries | [Factory Lab](./factory/README.md) |
| 📋 **Claims** | Triage incoming claims and recommend actions at ClaimSight Insurance | [Claims Lab](./claims/README.md) |
| 📞 **Call Center** | Classify call intents and advise resolutions at NovaTel Communications | [Call Center Lab](./callcenter/README.md) |
| 💰 **ValueLeak AI** | Turn Hidden Waste into Measurable Value. | [valueleak Lab](./valueleak/README.md) |


All scenarios follow the same 5-challenge structure:

| # | Challenge | Duration | What You'll Learn |
|---|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| 0 | **Setup** | 20 min | Provision Microsoft Foundry, deploy a model, verify auth |
| 1 | **Build Agents** | 35 min | Create two agents with tools and system prompts |
| 2 | **Monitor** | 20 min | Enable GenAI tracing with Application Insights |
| 3 | **Evaluate** | 25 min | Run LLM-as-judge evaluations against test datasets |
| 4 | **Workflow** | 20 min | Orchestrate agents in a multi-step pipeline |

## Prerequisites

- **Azure subscription** with **Contributor** and **Foundry User** access
- A **GitHub account**
- **Python 3.10+** installed locally (pre-installed when using Codespaces)
- **Azure CLI** (`az`) installed (pre-installed when using Codespaces)
